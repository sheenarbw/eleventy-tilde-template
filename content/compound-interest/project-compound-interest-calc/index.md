Use google spreadsheets to play with some numbers. Maybe give people the spreadsheet and then let them plug in numbers and play
Initially set some small values for monthly commitment and interest rate, show them how to calculate what their balance would be over the next 5-10 years
Ask them to plug in a number for how much money they would currently be able to save/invest per month and then look at total money and total interest etc. Ask questions like: how does x compare to your current monthly salary? How long would it take you to save up for goal y at this rate (eg: a small car, or a trip to europe)
