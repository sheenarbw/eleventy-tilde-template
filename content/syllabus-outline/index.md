One thing to note: Most online learning solutions resemble clever textbooks. What Tilde allows is something more like a knowld\edge graph.

Nodes on the graph represent content top read or projects to do. The edges of the graph show prerequisites.

So the idea is that we build out a syllabus that shows what order we think things should go in, and then the students can choose to do things in a different order if they want to. Cards on their Tilde boards will be "blocked" until all prerequisite cards are complete. So they can't do things in an insane order, but do have some agency.
